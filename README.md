*This is a Working directory for the project*

We are a small team of 3rd year french students in computer science at the INSA Rennes, France.

**Our goal is to improve autocompletion in LaTeXila, and maybe more...**

LaTeXila is a LaTeX editor for the Gnome project.
If you don't know it, check [the Gnome project page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/LaTeXila)

Objectives
----------
  - improve autocompletion of \ref
  - provide a guide (in english and french) for begginers contributors

Latex writing rules
-------------------
  - One sentence per line (to clean up git diff)
  - It's better to commit at each change that to commit all your work at the end of the day

The Team
--------
  - Axel "ShadowsWalker" Caro
  - François "Tyzeppelin" Boschet
  - Maximilien "halfa" Richer
