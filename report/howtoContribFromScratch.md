How to contribute to Latexila ?
===============================

This document is designed for the begginers who want to start to contribute to a Gnome software. Latexila will be taken as an example, but this document can help for many other software from the **Gnome Project**.

Goal
----
The goal of this document is to provide a walkthrought as complete as possible of the setup of a Latexila devlopper environement.

We choose Fedora as a starting point because it's the Linux distribution providing the broader support for the Gnome environement.

Resources

[The Gnome project website for devloppers](https://developer.gnome.org/)
[Latexila's page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/LaTeXila)

Prerequired
-----------

### Computer
We assume that you have at you disposal a fresh or not-so-broken install of Fedora (21 preferred), and a resonable disk remaining (more than 3Gb).
We assume you have administrator's priviledges.

### Human

You can copy/paste in most terminals using 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'C' and 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'V'.
